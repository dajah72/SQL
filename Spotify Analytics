# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#First, I determined the average danceability, popularity, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(danceability),
AVG(popularity),
AVG(energy)
FROM SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM SpotifyData
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Then I determined what the song key is for the Top 10 most popular songs.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, song_key
FROM SpotifyData
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#I determined the number of distinct artists that make up the Top 50 songs of 2021.
SELECT COUNT(distinct artist_name)
FROM SpotifyData;

#And which artists had more than 1 song in the list of Top 50 songs. 
SELECT artist_name
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(artist_name)>1;

#Finally, I created a case to display which songs work best on a Party Playlist, based on danceability and overall positivity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name,
CASE 
    WHEN danceability>0.70 AND valence>0.50 THEN 'Included in party playlist'
    ELSE 'Not included in party playlist'
END AS PartyPlaylist
FROM SpotifyData
WHERE PartyPlaylist= 'Included in party playlist';
